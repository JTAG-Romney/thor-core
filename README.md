What is Thor ?
----------------------

Thor is a coin based on scrypt POW algorithm, including DarkGravityWave ( difficulty changes after every mined block AND possible CURRENT block difficulty change over time to protect against high network hash variation and long stale tip ). For full details, please visit our website at https://thor-coin.tk . Compiled binary releases are available on Thor's github releases page here :

Thor Core is the full node software that makes up the backbone of the THOR network.


Characteristics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Hash Algorithm : SCRYPT POW algorithm    ( ASIC-friendly , GPU-friendly )

- The Forge : A " hodl and profit " mining system accessible to everyone, that works side by side with POW mining, invented by  LitecoinCash's team !!

- Total Supply : 86 000 000 THOR

- Fast block target time of 5 seconds !! 

- Number of confirmations needed for a transaction to be considered safe : 6  ( 30 seconds on average )

- Premine : 2 000 000 coins, barely above 2 % of max supply

- Block Reward : 5 Thor ( halved every 8 400 000 blocks, so every 16 months on average )

- Brand New Blockchain  ( downloading the new blockchain or re indexing it and syncing with the network actually takes less than 1 minute on average with a normal internet speed )

- Difficulty adjusted every block and possibly in CURRENT block if a long network stale tip happens !! This protects Thor from high hash variations and " high hash attacks " , that happens frequently for new and unprepared coins and kills them by making the mining difficulty too high for the " normal " network's hash rate.
